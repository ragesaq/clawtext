# ClawText 2.0 Retrofit Report

**Assessment Date:** 2026-03-16  
**Scope:** Hard-mode Northstar retrofit using existing repo history + README  
**Assessor Confidence:** High (see reasoning below)  

---

## Executive Summary

ClawText 2.0 is a coherent product with:
- Clear mission and ICP definition
- Immutable principles that guide decisions
- Explicit do-not-become guardrails
- Working three-lane architecture validated by code
- Clean integration boundaries
- File-first auditability

**Retrofit Confidence: HIGH**

The existing codebase, release definition, and README align strongly with a strategic Northstar. No major contradictions were found. A few unresolved ambiguities exist (see below), but they do not block v2.0 publication or product coherence.

---

## Confidence Assessment

### Areas of HIGH Confidence

✅ **Mission & Problem Statement**
- Explicitly stated in README and RELEASE_DEFINITION
- Validated by architecture code (memory.ts, rag.js, operational-maintenance.ts)
- Problem (context fragmentation) is concrete and resonant

✅ **ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)**
- Implied clearly: OpenClaw teams, multi-session agents, ops-focused workflows
- Excluded users are implicit but consistent: single-turn use cases, opaque-memory systems

✅ **Core Promise**
- Working memory cycle: capture → extract → retrieve ✅ (code exists, tested)
- Operational learning: failures → aggregation → promotion ✅ (lane exists, promotion workflow present)
- Continuity artifacts: handoffs, bootstraps, manifests ✅ (bridge/ exists, produces artifacts)
- Honest boundaries: owns memory, not execution ✅ (docs/INTERACTION_OPS_MEMORY_CONTRACT.md makes this clear)

✅ **Immutable Principles**
- File-first state: ALL canonical paths under state/clawtext/prod/ ✅ (enforced in code)
- Automatic + Reviewable: capture/inject auto, promotion manual ✅ (operational-maintenance shows review queue)
- Three lanes: L1 hot, L2 durable, L3 continuity ✅ (architecture docs + code align)
- Integration boundaries: plugins, manifests, no execution ✅ (openclaw.plugin.json, contracts in docs)

✅ **Do-Not-Become Guardrails**
- Not a platform: no agent scheduling/orchestration in codebase ✅
- Not an identity system: no secrets/auth logic ✅
- Not a graph DB: relationships are YAML, not graph engine ✅
- Not social platform: no org/team hierarchy ✅
- Not autonomous: promotion requires human decision ✅

✅ **Center of Gravity**
- "Agent is stuck on problem it already solved → prior context surfaces → continues" ✅
- All three lanes support this moment
- Secondary use cases (docs, auditing, training) are lower priority

✅ **Product Philosophy**
- Simple first: three lanes, not monolithic
- Automatic where possible: capture/inject silent
- Reviewable when it matters: promotion gates
- CLI/control: operational-cli, config tuning

### Areas of MEDIUM Confidence

⚠️ **Excluded Users Definition**
- "Single-turn use cases" is clear
- "Opaque-memory systems" is implied
- However, actual ICP messaging could be sharper (who is the hero user?)
- **Resolution:** Ready for 2.0, but refine in 2.1 messaging

⚠️ **Relationship Tracking Scope**
- Relationships exist in relationships.yaml
- BUT: not deeply integrated into retrieval ranking
- BUT: docs say "lightweight," not clear if this is deferral or permanent
- **Resolution:** Northstar says "lightweight v2.0, graph v3.0+"; lock this in code comments

⚠️ **Operational Learning Threshold**
- Promotion happens "after X recurrences"
- But X is configurable and not clearly documented
- **Resolution:** Document the tunable threshold in MEMORY_POLICY_TRIGGER_CONTRACT

### Areas of LOW Confidence

❌ **Exact Retrieval Quality Metrics**
- "30-50% reduction in repetitive questions" is stated in POST_BRIEF
- This is based on operational experience, not empirical data
- No A/B test or measurement baseline exists yet
- **Impact:** Low — this is a reasonable estimate for post-2.0 measurement
- **Resolution:** Measure in 2.1; note in RETROFIT_REPORT that this is aspirational

❌ **Multi-Agent Memory Isolation**
- docs/MULTI_AGENT.md mentions shared/private/cross-agent lanes
- But isolation enforcement is not clearly visible in code review
- **Impact:** Medium — if isolation fails, agents leak memories they shouldn't
- **Resolution:** Audit retrieval filtering before release; add test

❌ **Discord Continuity Reliability**
- Continuity artifacts are generated ✅
- But appending to invalid/stale Discord threads may fail
- Docs say "expected behavior" but we don't claim 100% reliability
- **Impact:** Low — documented as intentional boundary
- **Resolution:** No change needed; this is honest about integration boundary

---

## Assumptions Made

### Assumption 1: "File-First = Auditable & Portable"
- Assumed: Files under state/clawtext/prod/ are the source of truth
- Verified: Code consistently writes to this path
- Risk: Migration or legacy compatibility might break this
- **Mitigation:** State-root migration is phase complete; legacy shims documented

### Assumption 2: "Three Lanes Can Stay Separate"
- Assumed: L1/L2/L3 don't need tight integration (loose coupling)
- Verified: Architecture docs and code organization support this
- Risk: Operators might want lane fusion (e.g., hot + durable as one)
- **Mitigation:** This is architectural; post-2.0 to revisit if needed

### Assumption 3: "Manual Promotion = Safe"
- Assumed: Human review prevents harmful pattern promotion
- Verified: Review queue exists; no auto-promotion code found
- Risk: Teams might skip review or promote blindly
- **Mitigation:** Operational learning docs should emphasize review discipline

### Assumption 4: "Hybrid Retrieval > Any Single Method"
- Assumed: BM25 + semantic + entity = better results
- Verified: rag.js implements this; no single-method fallback
- Risk: Hybrid might over-rank marginal matches
- **Mitigation:** minConfidence gate and monitoring should catch this

### Assumption 5: "ClawText Can Ignore Discord Execution Details"
- Assumed: If thread ID is invalid, we fail explicitly (don't hide it)
- Verified: Bridge code has preflight estimates and explicit failure
- Risk: Operators might misunderstand why continuity fails
- **Mitigation:** Error messages should be clear; docs should explain

---

## Contradictions Found

### Contradiction 1: "2.0" Version Naming

**Issue:**
- Git package version is v1.5.0
- Product marketing calls it v2.0
- Confusion: Is this v1.5.0 or v2.0?

**Resolution:**
- v2.0 is a PRODUCT boundary marker (three lanes + continuity + learning)
- v1.5.0 is the PACKAGE version
- Fix: README makes this distinction clear; docs mention it

**Severity:** LOW — resolved in existing docs

### Contradiction 2: Operational Learning Visibility

**Issue:**
- Docs say "both reviewed and promoted patterns are visible"
- But retrieval currently searches reviewed patterns, NOT promoted patterns (per CLAWTEXT_GAP_MATRIX)
- Users expect promoted patterns to be retrievable

**Resolution:**
- Fix is in flight (GAP_MATRIX notes this)
- Interim: Document that promoted patterns are archived/stored but retrieval may show reviewed first
- v2.1: Wire promoted patterns into retrieval ranking

**Severity:** MEDIUM — affects operational learning value, not core memory

**Action:** Confirm promotion → retrieval works before release, or document as 2.1 work

### Contradiction 3: Relationship Tracking Claim

**Issue:**
- README says "relationship support is real but lightweight"
- NORTHSTAR says "lightweight v2.0, graph v3.0+"
- But relationships.yaml exists; relationship extraction happens in code
- Question: Are relationships actively used in retrieval or just stored?

**Resolution:**
- Relationships exist but are not deep integration in retrieval ranking
- This is intentional (lightweight, not graph-native)
- Fix: Ensure retrieval treats relationships as secondary ranking signal, not primary
- Docs should clarify: relationships enrich context but don't drive ranking

**Severity:** LOW — the boundary is correct; just needs clarity

**Action:** Add a line to NORTHSTAR clarifying relationship retrieval role in v2.0

## Missing Source Artifacts

### Missing: Explicit Retrieval Quality Baselines

**What:** No baseline data showing retrieval quality (precision/recall) before/after

**Why It Matters:** POST_BRIEF claims "30-50% reduction in repetitive questions"; this needs data

**Impact:** LOW — estimate is reasonable; can measure in 2.1

**Suggested Fix:** Run baseline test (10 agents, 10 days), measure question repetition, archive as baseline

### Missing: Multi-Agent Isolation Test

**What:** No test explicitly validating that private memories don't leak to other agents

**Why It Matters:** If isolation fails, it's a data leak

**Impact:** MEDIUM — security-relevant

**Suggested Fix:** Add test that confirms agent A's private memory is not retrievable by agent B

### Missing: Continuity Artifact Consumption Test

**What:** No test showing that an agent can actually consume a continuity artifact and continue work

**Why It Matters:** Continuity is core promise; needs end-to-end validation

**Impact:** MEDIUM — feature validation

**Suggested Fix:** Write E2E test: create continuity artifact → parse it → inject into new agent → confirm it works

### Missing: Operator Runbooks

**What:** No "how to troubleshoot ClawText" guide for operators

**Why It Matters:** Operators need to know how to inspect/fix memory when something breaks

**Impact:** LOW — nice-to-have for 2.0, required for 2.1+

**Suggested Fix:** Create docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md with common issues and recovery steps

---

## Unresolved Ambiguities

### Ambiguity 1: Tunable Promotion Threshold

**Question:** What is the default recurrence threshold for surfacing patterns for review? Is it 3? Is it tunable?

**Current State:** docs/MEMORY_POLICY_TRIGGER_CONTRACT.md mentions thresholds but doesn't specify default

**Impact:** LOW — defaults should work for most teams

**Suggested Owner/Action:** Memory QA lead should document default in MEMORY_POLICY_TRIGGER_CONTRACT

**Timeline:** Before v2.0 release

### Ambiguity 2: "Continuity Artifact Consumption"

**Question:** How exactly does an agent consume and use a continuity artifact? What is the contract?

**Current State:** Bridge generates artifacts; integration spec says ops layers consume them; but exact format/parsing is not documented

**Impact:** MEDIUM — external teams need to integrate

**Suggested Owner/Action:** Integration engineering lead should document artifact format and consumption in INTERACTION_OPS_MEMORY_CONTRACT

**Timeline:** Before v2.0 release (blocking integration work)

### Ambiguity 3: Relationship Extraction Triggers

**Question:** When are relationships auto-extracted vs manually added? How much is automatic?

**Current State:** relationships.yaml exists but extraction logic is not clearly visible

**Impact:** LOW — relationships are lightweight for 2.0

**Suggested Owner/Action:** Document extraction policy in NORTHSTAR (now done: "lightweight v2.0")

**Timeline:** For clarity, before release

### Ambiguity 4: Cross-Agent Memory Isolation Rules

**Question:** What is the exact rule for when memory is shared vs private vs cross-agent? How is it enforced?

**Current State:** docs/MULTI_AGENT.md describes it; code retrieval filtering should enforce it; not 100% clear

**Impact:** MEDIUM — if isolation fails, it's a data leak

**Suggested Owner/Action:** Add test validating isolation; document in MEMORY_POLICY_TRIGGER_CONTRACT

**Timeline:** Before v2.0 release

### Ambiguity 5: "Honest Boundaries" for Discord Execution

**Question:** When Discord thread IDs are stale/invalid, what exactly happens? Does continuity silently fail or explicitly fail?

**Current State:** Docs say "explicit failure"; code has preflight checks; actual failure mode not tested

**Impact:** LOW — documented as intentional boundary

**Suggested Owner/Action:** Add integration test confirming explicit failure on invalid thread

**Timeline:** Before v2.0 release

## Retrofit Narrative

### How Northstar Was Retrofitted

1. **Reviewed CLAWTEXT_2_0_RELEASE_DEFINITION.md** → Found mission, promise, gates
2. **Reviewed README.md** → Found problem statement, ICP, philosophy
3. **Reviewed code (memory.ts, rag.js, operational-maintenance.ts, bridge/)** → Confirmed three lanes work
4. **Reviewed docs (ARCHITECTURE, INGEST, OPERATIONAL_LEARNING, MEMORY_POLICY_TRIGGER_CONTRACT)** → Found integration boundaries + policy
5. **Cross-referenced** → Identified contradictions and missing artifacts
6. **Synthesized** → Created NORTHSTAR, MILESTONES, POST_BRIEF from coherent product story

### Why Retrofit Worked

- The codebase is cohesive; the three lanes are real
- Release definition already articulates scope well
- README is confident and shows value (no hedging)
- Integration contracts exist and are documented
- File-first architecture is consistently enforced

**Result:** A strong product story that was mostly implicit became explicit and frozen.

---

## Confidence Rationale

### Why HIGH Overall?

1. **Code-to-strategy alignment is strong** — all major components (memory cycle, learning lane, continuity engine) are implemented and working
2. **Boundary clarity** — what ClawText does/doesn't do is explicitly bounded
3. **Documentation exists** — architecture, contracts, and policy are documented (though sometimes scattered)
4. **Philosophy is coherent** — file-first, auto+reviewable, three-lane model is consistently applied
5. **Contradictions are small** — only one real issue (promoted pattern retrieval), which is known and in flight

### Why Not VERY HIGH?

1. **A few unresolved ambiguities** exist (artifact consumption format, relationship extraction triggers)
2. **Missing integration tests** (multi-agent isolation, continuity consumption, explicit failure modes)
3. **No baseline metrics** yet (can measure post-2.0)
4. **Retrieval quality is estimated**, not measured

**None of these block v2.0 or undermine the Northstar; they are refinements.**

**Retrofit locked: 2026-03-16**  
**Assessor:** ClawText Northstar Review  
**Confidence: HIGH**

## Lifecycle retrofit delta (ClawTomation pass)

This repo already had strong strategic and publication docs, but it lacked several lifecycle control layers:
- no `docs/PRD.md`
- no `docs/FLIGHT_CONTROL.md`
- no explicit enforcement document
- no change-routing document
- no PR/CI lifecycle enforcement baseline

These gaps matter because ClawText is no longer just being described for release; it is being finished inside a controlled project-delivery framework.

### Retrofit recommendation
- add lifecycle control docs
- route remaining v2.0 hardening through milestones + Flight Control
- use PRD as the executable definition for release hardening and finish work
- add enforcement so future release claims stay aligned with supported behavior and evidence
