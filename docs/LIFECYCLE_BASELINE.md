## Notes / exceptions
- ClawText is the sole public PsiClawOps repo.
- Pre-existing governance docs (NORTHSTAR, PRD, MILESTONES, FLIGHT_CONTROL, POST_BRIEF) retained as-is — rich pre-ClawTomation content.
- NORTHSTAR.md does not yet have ClawTomation YAML front matter (project_structure field) — retained in original format, no breaking change.
- Enforcement mode: private-stealth (github-hard blocked by GitHub plan).
