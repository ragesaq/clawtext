# ClawSaver

Automatic session message batching for OpenClaw. Reduces model API costs by 20–40% with zero configuration.

## What It Does

When users send multiple messages in quick succession, ClawSaver waits ~800ms to collect them, then sends **one batched request** instead of multiple calls. Same answer quality, lower cost.

**Example:**
```
User: "What is machine learning?"
(300ms) User: "Give me an example."
(400ms) User: "How does that apply to fraud detection?"
```

- Without batching: 3 API calls
- With ClawSaver: 1 API call + 1 concatenated prompt

## Install

```bash
clawhub install clawsaver
```

## Setup (10 lines)

```javascript
import SessionDebouncer from 'clawsaver';

const debouncers = new Map();

function handleUserMessage(userId, text) {
  if (!debouncers.has(userId)) {
    debouncers.set(userId, new SessionDebouncer(
      userId,
      (msgs) => callModel(userId, msgs)
    ));
  }
  debouncers.get(userId).enqueue({ text });
}
```

That's it. No config needed. Default settings work for most use cases.

## Profiles

Three pre-tuned configurations:

### Balanced (default)
- 25–35% savings
- 800ms wait
- Good for: general chat

### Aggressive
- 35–45% savings
- 1.5s wait
- Good for: batch workflows

### Real-Time
- 5–10% savings
- 200ms wait
- Good for: voice assistants

See **INTEGRATION.md** for usage examples.

## Why It Works

**Users don't notice the delay.** They're already waiting for your model to respond anyway. ClawSaver batches while they wait—same total latency, lower cost.

Typical flow:
- Without batching: send → (3s model latency) → respond
- With batching: send → (0.8s wait) → (2.2s model latency) → respond

Same 3s end-to-end. No user friction.

## When to Use

✅ Chat applications  
✅ Customer support bots  
✅ Q&A systems  
✅ Any conversation with follow-up questions  

❌ Single-message workflows  
❌ Voice assistants needing <100ms response

## Key API

### Constructor
```javascript
new SessionDebouncer(userId, handler, options?)
```

### Methods
- `enqueue(message)` — Add to batch
- `forceFlush(reason)` — Send now
- `getState()` — Check buffer & metrics
- `getStatusString()` — Human-readable status

### Options
```javascript
{
  debounceMs: 800,        // wait time
  maxWaitMs: 3000,        // max wait
  maxMessages: 5,         // batch size
  maxTokens: 2048         // reserved
}
```

## External Endpoints

None. ClawSaver runs locally and forwards to your existing model caller.

## Security & Privacy

- **No telemetry** — Doesn't track batches or usage
- **No network calls** — All logic runs on your machine
- **No dependencies** — Pure JavaScript, zero npm packages
- **Your model handler** — You control what gets sent

Data stays on your machine.
