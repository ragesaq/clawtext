# HOW_THINGS_WORK.md — Operational Procedures

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-12 16:47 UTC

This file documents **how to do things** in the system. Read this when you need to perform an action.

---

## 📝 Writing Product Documentation

**See:** [`docs/GOLD_STANDARD_POST_PATTERNS.md`](./docs/GOLD_STANDARD_POST_PATTERNS.md)

Reusable patterns for high-quality product READMEs, product announcements, and documentation. Maintains consistency across products while supporting flexibility.

**Covers:**
- Problem statement + concrete example
- Architecture/feature deep dives (tables, diagrams, flows)
- Version history table (showing evolution across releases)
- "What's New" sections (feature-focused, not just changelog)
- Installation + agent-assisted setup
- Role-based documentation map
- Length calibration (utility vs. system products)
- Quality checklist

**Use this when:**
- Writing a new product README
- Adding major features to existing docs
- Creating skill documentation
- Announcing new releases

---

## 📦 Building OpenClaw Plugins

**See:** [`PLUGIN_STANDARDS.md`](./PLUGIN_STANDARDS.md)

Standard practices for developing, packaging, and releasing OpenClaw plugins. Based on ClawText v1.4.1 implementation.

Covers:
- Package structure and naming (@openclaw scoping)
- Documentation standards (README, SKILL.md, AGENT_SETUP.md)
- Installation workflow (plugin CLI, agent-led setup, migration)
- Configuration & tuning patterns
- Version management
- Quality checklist

---

## 🔧 Core Operations

### 1. Restart the Gateway (Requires User Confirmation)

**When:** After config changes, plugin updates, or crashes

**Process:**
```bash
# Step 1: Check active sessions
sessions_list --limit 20

# Step 2: Send confirmation message to user
message(action=send, channel=discord, 
  message="🔄 Ready to restart when you are.
Changes: [list what changed]
Active sessions: [list, or 'none']
Impact: [what gets interrupted]")

# Step 3: WAIT FOR USER TO SAY "go ahead" or "restart" or "do it"

# Step 4: Only then trigger restart
gateway(action=restart, note="[human-readable reason]")

# Step 5: System auto-pings last active session when back up
```

**Important:**
- ❌ NEVER restart without explicit user confirmation
- ❌ Always check sessions_list first (if agents running, user may want to wait)
- ✅ Include impact summary in confirmation message
- ✅ Use clear human language in `note` parameter

---

### 2. Deploy or Update a Skill

**Example: ClawText RAG Plugin**

```bash
# Step 1: Update source files
~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext-rag/plugin.js
~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext-rag/src/rag.js

# Step 2: Verify skill is registered in openclaw.json
cat ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json | grep -A5 "clawtext-rag"

# Step 3: Test locally (if applicable)
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext-rag
npm test (or node test.mjs)

# Step 4: Restart gateway
gateway(action=restart, note="Updated ClawText RAG plugin")

# Step 5: Verify with a test query
# (RAG injection should activate automatically)
```

---

### 3. Update Memory & Rebuild Clusters

**When:** After adding/modifying memory files

```bash
# Step 1: Add YAML headers to memory files (if new)
# Template: see DAILY_LOG_TEMPLATE.md

# Step 2: Rebuild clusters
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext
node scripts/build-clusters.js --force

# Step 3: Check output
# Should show: "15+ clusters produced, 700+ memories indexed"

# Step 4: No restart needed (clusters loaded dynamically)

# Step 5: Validate RAG injection quality
node scripts/validate-rag.js --verbose

# Step 6: Review recommendations from validation tool
# (Tool samples 9 queries, reports confidence, suggests tuning)
```

**Automating Cluster Rebuild (Optional):**

To keep clusters fresh automatically, create a weekly cron job:

```bash
cron(action=add, job={
  name: "Rebuild ClawText clusters (weekly)",
  schedule: { kind: "cron", expr: "0 2 * * 0", tz: "UTC" },
  payload: { 
    kind: "systemEvent", 
    text: "Rebuilding ClawText clusters to index new memories" 
  },
  sessionTarget: "main",
  enabled: false  # Agent/user enables during onboarding
})
```

**Agent Onboarding Question:**
When an agent joins and discovers the ClawText system, ask the user:

> "Would you like me to set up automatic cluster rebuilds every Sunday at 02:00 UTC? This keeps memory search fresh after you add new knowledge. I can enable it now, or you can configure it manually later."

If user agrees, set `enabled: true` in the cron job above.

---

### 4. Validate RAG Quality (Phase 2 Tool)

**When:** After rebuilding clusters, or to troubleshoot poor memory injection

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext
node scripts/validate-rag.js            # Concise report
node scripts/validate-rag.js --verbose  # Detailed results per query
node scripts/validate-rag.js --output json  # Machine-readable format
```

**Output Includes:**
- 9 sample queries across projects (MoltMUD, OpenClaw, Memory System)
- Per-query confidence scores (0.0–1.0)
- Memory count per query
- Overall quality score (0–100%)
- Tuning recommendations based on results

**When to Use:**
- After `build-clusters.js --force` (verify clusters were rebuilt correctly)
- If agents report missing context (check if injection is working)
- Before adjusting RAG tuning (baseline before/after comparison)
- During onboarding (verify system is operational)

---

### 5. Launch MoltMUD Phase 2 Streams

**When:** Ready to build Perception, Memory, Executor modules

**Process:**

```bash
# Step 1: Create Discord forum post for Stream 1
message(action=thread-create,
  channel=1475021817168134144,  # ai-projects forum
  name="[gpt-5-mini] Perception Module — Parse LOOK/STAT to JSON",
  message="[Full specification from brief]")

# Step 2: Wait for lumbot (me) to respond with code
# (User then answers Q&A in-thread)

# Step 3: Repeat for Stream 2 (Memory) and Stream 3 (Executor)

# Step 4: Monitor for completions (~45 min total)

# Step 5: Extract Memory schema from Stream 2 result

# Step 6: Provide schema to Stream 4 (Decision Module)
```

---

## 🔍 Debugging & Diagnostics

### Diagnose 400 Error

**When:** Discord messages fail with `invalid_request_body`

```bash
# Step 1: Check gateway logs
openclaw status

# Step 2: Look for error pattern
# - If context overflow: reduce maxMemories in plugin.js
# - If tool formatting: check message() tool call structure

# Step 3: Test with minimal message
message(action=send, channel=discord, message="Test")
# If works, issue is with complex messages

# Step 4: Reduce RAG injection if needed
# Edit: ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext-rag/plugin.js
# Change: maxMemories: 7 → 5 (reduce context)
# Restart gateway

# Step 5: Re-test
```

### Diagnose Cron Timeout

**When:** error-monitor or background-light-agent fails repeatedly

```bash
# Step 1: Check job logs
cron(action=runs, jobId=1984869e-de56-492d-a8b5-d3ef4b8e118c)

# Step 2: Look at last execution
# - Check: what LLM work was requested?
# - Check: how long did it take?
# - Check: did it timeout or fail?

# Step 3: Options to fix:
# A) Reduce work (simplify LLM prompt)
# B) Increase timeout (in cron job config)
# C) Switch to cheaper model (GitHub Copilot FREE)
# D) Reschedule (longer interval, less frequent)

# Step 4: Update job
cron(action=update, jobId=1984869e-de56-492d-a8b5-d3ef4b8e118c, 
  patch={timeoutSeconds: 60})  # increase timeout example

# Step 5: Monitor next run
```

### Check System Health

```bash
# Full status
openclaw status

# List active sessions
sessions_list --limit 20

# Check memory/cluster status
ls ~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/clusters/
wc -l ~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/clusters/*.json

# Check cron jobs
cron(action=list)

# Verify RAG is working
grep "clawtext-rag" ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

# Validate RAG quality
node ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext/scripts/validate-rag.js
```

---

## 📥 Data Ingestion & Deduplication

**When:** Importing memories from files, URLs, chat exports, or API responses

### Standard Ingestion Flow

```bash
# Step 1: Use ClawText Ingest for multi-source ingestion
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext-ingest

# Step 2: Write ingest script
node -e "
import ClawTextIngest from './src/index.js';
const ingest = new ClawTextIngest();

// Ingest from markdown files
await ingest.fromFiles(['docs/**/*.md'], { 
  project: 'docs', 
  type: 'fact' 
});

// Ingest from JSON (e.g., Discord export, API response)
await ingest.fromJSON(chatArray, 
  { project: 'team', type: 'decision' },
  { keyMap: { contentKey: 'message', dateKey: 'timestamp', authorKey: 'user' } }
);

// Ingest from raw text
await ingest.fromText(content, 
  { project: 'notes', type: 'learning', filename: 'custom-name.md' }
);

// Run all sources and persist hashes
const result = await ingest.ingestAll([...]);
console.log(\`Imported: \${result.totalImported}, Skipped: \${result.totalSkipped}\`);
"

# Step 3: Verify no duplicates
# - Check output: "Skipped: X" (means duplicates were detected & skipped)

# Step 4: Rebuild clusters
node ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext/scripts/build-clusters.js --force

# Step 5: Validate injection
node ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext/scripts/validate-rag.js

# Step 6: No restart needed (RAG reloads clusters automatically)
```

### Why Deduplication Matters

- **Problem:** Ingesting the same knowledge multiple times creates duplicate memories
- **Solution:** SHA1 hashing via `.ingest_hashes.json` prevents re-ingestion
- **Result:** Safe to run same ingest job 100x → zero duplicates

**Key:** Always call `.commit()` (or let `ingestAll()` handle it) to persist hashes to disk.

### Agent Ingestion Workflows

Agents can safely use ingestion in recurring tasks:

```javascript
// Example: Daily memory sync (safe to run every day)
import ClawTextIngest from './src/index.js';

async function dailyMemorySync() {
  const ingest = new ClawTextIngest();
  
  // This runs daily, but deduplication prevents duplicate entries
  await ingest.fromFiles(['data/**/*.md'], { project: 'daily' });
  const result = await ingest.ingestAll([...]);
  
  // Report: some new (imported), some skipped (duplicates)
  return result;
}
```
