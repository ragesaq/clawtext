## How Memory Works in Agent Systems

### The Problem

Every time an LLM processes a request, it builds a prompt from three layers:

1. **System instructions** — Core rules and identity (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md in OpenClaw)
2. **Context** — Background information to inform the response
3. **Current request** — What you're asking right now

Without persistent memory, the context layer is empty. Every session starts from zero:

```
Session 1:
[System] + [CONTEXT: EMPTY] + "Where was Caesar's greatest military victory?"
→ Response: "Battle of Alesia in 52 BC"

Session 2 (new conversation):
[System] + [CONTEXT: EMPTY] + "Who was that guy he defeated in that battle you told me about yesterday?"
→ Response: "What battle? I don't have any context from our previous conversation."

With a memory system:
[System] + [CONTEXT: Battle of Alesia, Caesar's military history] + "Who was that guy he defeated?"
→ Response: "Vercingetorix, the Gallic chieftain. That victory at Alesia was decisive because..."
```

Memory systems fill that context layer with information that persists across sessions. The agent remembers previous conversations, decisions, and can build on past work rather than relearning the same things.

### OpenClaw's Built-In Memory

OpenClaw agents already have basic memory through `MEMORY.md` — a static file for recording decisions and facts. It works for small projects. It doesn't scale. It requires manual maintenance and can't grow beyond a few hundred entries.

**ClawText doesn't replace `MEMORY.md`; it complements it.** MEMORY.md stays high-signal and hand-curated. ClawText handles the dynamic, scalable parts: conversational captures, bulk imports, tiered retrieval, automatic maintenance, and learned patterns from failures.

---

## What Is ClawText?

ClawText is a knowledge lifecycle system with three integrated lanes:

| Lane | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Working Memory** | Captures conversation context automatically. Tiered retrieval injects the right memories at prompt time. |
| **Knowledge Ingest** | Bulk-loads repos, docs, Discord forums/threads, exports, and other structured knowledge sources. Queryable on-demand. |
| **Operational Learning** | Captures tool failures and recurring errors. Reviews patterns with agents. Promotes stable lessons into durable guidance. |

---

## What's New in v1.4.0

### Automatic Memory Pipeline

ClawText now runs a three-stage pipeline automatically:

1. **Extraction (every 20 min)** — Messages captured to `memory/extract-buffer.jsonl`, then extracted facts/decisions/learnings written to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` using LLM
2. **Clustering (nightly)** — Daily 2am UTC cron rebuilds semantic clusters from daily memories, validates RAG quality, notifies if confidence < 70%
3. **Injection (every prompt)** — `before_prompt_build` hook injects top 5 relevant memories (by BM25 + semantic similarity) automatically — zero latency (~1ms), token-budgeted, confidence-filtered

**Result:** You get context-aware responses without manual memory searches. All memories are discoverable via `memory_search` as well.

### Bundled Ingest Engine

Knowledge ingest engine is now fully bundled into ClawText (previously separate `clawtext-ingest` package). Supports Discord, repos, docs, JSON, and more — all in one install.

### State Root Adoption

Runtime-generated state now lives under `~/.openclaw/workspace/state/clawtext/prod/`:
- Cluster indices
- Evaluation metrics
- Extraction checkpoints

This keeps the repo clean and separates sources (git-tracked) from runtime state (not git-tracked).

---

## Three Lanes in Depth

### Lane 1: Working Memory

Captures from conversations and stores them in a tiered system. Memory doesn't just sit there — the system actively retrieves and injects the most relevant items at prompt time.

```
Conversation captures
       ↓
Conversational → Raw staging buffer (L4)
       ↓ review/promotion
Gets validated, ranked, deduped
       ↓
Full history searchable (L3)
       ↓ hot-admitted by relevance score
Curated, indexed memories (L2)
       ↓ selected, injected into prompt
Fast retrieval (~1ms) (L1)
```

**Key properties:**
- **BM25 scoring** — term frequency + confidence weighting + project-aware ranking
- **Semantic clustering** — memories grouped by topic, not just timestamp
- **Deduplication** — SHA1 hashing prevents re-storing duplicate knowledge
- **Token budgeting** — never exceeds your configured prompt context budget
- **Sticky retention** — high-value memories stay readily available longer

#### How Conversation Capture Works

ClawText automatically captures all conversation context (incoming and outgoing messages) without any action on your part.

**The pipeline (fully automatic):**

```
Every message event (in/out)
       ↓
[clawtext-extract hook] — appends to buffer (zero-LLM-cost)
       ↓ (asynchronous)
Memory/extract-buffer.jsonl (rolling 24h buffer)
       ↓ every 20 minutes
[Extraction cron] — LLM extracts facts, decisions, learnings
       ↓
Memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (YAML-formatted daily memories)
       ↓ triggered if 3+ extracted
[Cluster rebuild] — semantic grouping, dedup, indexing
       ↓
Hot cache + RAG injection
       ↓
Injected automatically into next prompt (~1ms latency)
```

**Key points:**
- **Hook runs on every message** — captures both you and the agent
- **Zero cost at capture time** — just appends JSON lines to a buffer file
- **Automatic extraction every 20 minutes** — background cron processes the buffer
- **Session flush on `/new`** — if you start a fresh conversation, the current buffer drains immediately so nothing is lost
- **Daily rebuild at 2am UTC** — full cluster rebuild + quality validation
- **Format stored** — JSONL in buffer, then YAML in daily memory files:

```yaml
# Example extracted memory
- id: mem_20260310_001
  timestamp: 2026-03-10T09:02:00Z
  type: decision
  topic: ClawText
  content: "Decided to bundle clawtext-ingest into main package for unified installation story"
  confidence: 0.95
  project: openclaw
```

**You don't need to do anything.** Conversation capture is always on. The system handles extraction, clustering, deduplication, and injection automatically.

---

### Lane 2: Knowledge Ingest

Bulk-loads external knowledge sources into a searchable base kept separate from working memory. Why separate? Injecting a 500KB codebase into every prompt wastes tokens and confuses the LLM. Knowledge repos live separately — your agent queries them on-demand when it needs specifics.

**Supported sources:**
- GitHub repos and local code directories
- Markdown/documentation folders
- Discord forums, channels, and threads (with full conversation hierarchy)
- JSON exports from any source
- Raw text and structured data

```bash
# Ingest a Discord forum
npm run ingest:discord -- --forum-id 123456789 --mode batch --verbose

# Ingest a folder of docs
clawtext-ingest ingest-files --input="docs/**/*.md" --project=myproject

# Ingest a full codebase
clawtext-ingest ingest-files --input="src/**/*.{ts,js}" --project=myapp

# Check knowledge repo freshness
npm run knowledge:status
# → 🟢 fresh (<30d) | 🟡 aging (30-90d) | 🔴 stale (>90d)
```

Knowledge repos are automatically tracked for staleness. The system alerts you (and agents) when imports need refreshing.

---

### Lane 3: Operational Learning

The system learns from its own operational history. When tools fail or commands error, the system captures it. If the same error recurs, it becomes a pattern. Agents review the pattern, decide if it's useful, and promote stable lessons into durable guidance.

**Lifecycle:**

```
Tool/command fails or hook fires
          ↓
    [Capture: raw]     ← automatic, no action needed
          ↓ recurs N times
    [Candidate]        ← pattern promoted when it repeats
          ↓ agent-led review
    [Reviewed]
      ↙         ↘
  reject       approve
    ↓              ↓
 Archived    Ready for promotion
                   ↓
    Agent proposes target + user confirms
                   ↓
           ┌──────────────────┐
           │ Durable Guidance │
           │ SOUL.md          │
           │ AGENTS.md        │
           │ TOOLS.md         │
           │ project docs     │
           └──────────────────┘
```

**What gets captured:**
- Tool failures (automatic via hooks)
- Command/script failures
- Repeated error patterns
- Successful recovery patterns
- Optimization discoveries

**Why this matters:**
Most memory systems optimize for prompt efficiency — faster retrieval, better token use, cleaner context injection. Operational learning goes further: it makes the *system itself* more reliable. Recurring failures become reviewed guidance. Agent and system both learn from the same operational history. Over time, the system gets more robust and self-healing.

---

## Safety and Quality Model

ClawText is designed to avoid the two biggest memory failures:

1. **Storing things that should never be stored**
2. **Retrieving things that should never be injected**

Current controls include:

- **Hygiene patterns** for secrets and credentials
- **Raw-log detection** to keep pasted logs/tool dumps out of clusters
- **Anti-pattern walls** to block false associations
- **Token budgeting** for prompt injection
- **Approval-gated promotion** for durable operational guidance
- **File-based auditability** instead of hidden database state

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) and [RISK.md](./RISK.md) for detailed threat models.

## Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/clawtext
```

That's it. OpenClaw handles dependency installation, registration, and plugin activation automatically.

### What `openclaw plugins install` Does

- ✅ Downloads ClawText from npm
- ✅ Extracts to `~/.openclaw/extensions/clawtext/`
- ✅ Runs `npm install --ignore-scripts`
- ✅ Registers in `plugins.installs` config
- ✅ Enables the plugin automatically

### Configuration (Optional)

After installation, customize memory behavior in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "clawtext": {
        "enabled": true,
        "memorySearch": {
          "sync": { "onSessionStart": true },
          "maxMemories": 5,
          "minConfidence": 0.70
        },
        "clusters": {
          "rebuildInterval": "0 2 * * *",
          "validationThreshold": 0.70
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check plugin loaded
openclaw plugins list
# Expected: clawtext | enabled | loaded

# Check gateway status
openclaw gateway status
# Expected: running

# Validate memory quality
openclaw plugins run clawtext validate
```

### Updates

Keep ClawText up to date:

```bash
openclaw plugins update clawtext
```

Or update all plugins:

```bash
openclaw plugins update --all
```

### Development / Local Setup

For development or modification:

```bash
# Link local copy for development
openclaw plugins install -l ./path/to/clawtext
```

Or clone and install manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ragesaq/clawtext.git
cd clawtext
npm install
npm run build
openclaw plugins install -l .
```

### Agent-Assisted Setup

If you prefer guided setup, ask an agent:

```
Please help me set up ClawText for this workspace.
I want to:
1. Install via `openclaw plugins install @openclaw/clawtext`
2. Configure memory search (maxMemories, thresholds)
3. Run a quick health check
4. Then we can ingest [my project docs / a Discord forum / a code repo]

Assume I'm comfortable with shell commands if needed, but prefer you to handle the details.
```

See [AGENT_SETUP.md](./AGENT_SETUP.md) for full agent-assisted workflow.

---

## Migration from Manual Installation (≤v1.3.x)

If you have ClawText installed via git clone in `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext`:

### Agent-Led Migration

Ask an agent to handle it:

```
I have an older ClawText installation (git clone in ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext).
I want to migrate to the new plugin-based installation so I can use `openclaw plugins update`.

Can you:
1. Install via `openclaw plugins install @openclaw/clawtext`
2. Verify both versions aren't running
3. Update my config to remove old manual paths
4. Clean up the old directory
5. Test everything works
```

Most agents can follow `AGENT_SETUP.md` → Migration section and handle it end-to-end.

### Manual Migration

If you prefer to do it yourself:

```bash
# 1. Install via plugin system
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/clawtext

# 2. Update ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
#    Remove these lines:
#      "plugins.load.paths"
#      "plugins.allow": ["clawtext"]
#
#    Keep only:
#      "plugins.entries.clawtext" with your config

# 3. Restart gateway
openclaw gateway restart

# 4. Verify
openclaw plugins list | grep clawtext

# 5. Clean up old directory (optional)
rm -rf ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawtext
```

---

## Optimal Configuration

The defaults work for most workflows. But here's the tuning guide if you want to optimize:

### Conservative (Low Token Budget)

Use this if you're token-conscious or working with smaller context windows:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "clawtext": {
        "enabled": true,
        "memorySearch": {
          "sync": { "onSessionStart": false },
          "maxMemories": 3,
          "minConfidence": 0.80,
          "tokenBudget": 1000
        },
        "clusters": {
          "rebuildInterval": "0 3 * * 0",
          "validationThreshold": 0.80
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Effect:**
- Only 3 memories injected per query (vs 5)
- Stricter relevance threshold (0.80 vs 0.70) — fewer false positives
- Smaller token budget (1000 vs 2000) — less prompt bloat
- Weekly cluster rebuild (Sundays 3am UTC) instead of nightly
- Memory injection **disabled on session start** (inject only on-demand)

**When to use:** Smaller models, tight token budgets, or if injection feels noisy

---

### Balanced (Default)

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "clawtext": {
        "enabled": true,
        "memorySearch": {
          "sync": { "onSessionStart": true },
          "maxMemories": 5,
          "minConfidence": 0.70
        },
        "clusters": {
          "rebuildInterval": "0 2 * * *",
          "validationThreshold": 0.70
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Effect:**
- 5 memories per query (sweet spot for most workflows)
- Moderate relevance threshold (0.70) — catches useful context, filters obvious noise
- Standard token budget (2000) — useful without bloat
- Nightly rebuild (2am UTC)
- Memory injection **on session start** (automatic context loading)

**When to use:** Most projects, balanced efficiency and context richness

---

### Aggressive (High Context)

Use this if you have room in your token budget and want maximum context:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "clawtext": {
        "enabled": true,
        "memorySearch": {
          "sync": { "onSessionStart": true },
          "maxMemories": 10,
          "minConfidence": 0.50,
          "tokenBudget": 4000
        },
        "clusters": {
          "rebuildInterval": "0 1 * * *",
          "validationThreshold": 0.65
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Effect:**
- 10 memories per query (maximum context)
- Permissive relevance threshold (0.50) — includes speculative/tangential info
- Large token budget (4000) — generous space for memory injection
- Frequent rebuild (nightly 1am UTC, can handle higher ingestion volume)
- Memory injection **on session start** (loads everything available)

**When to use:** Long projects, lots of context, working with larger models (GPT-5, Sonnet)

---

### Finding Your Optimal Setting

If you're unsure, start with **Balanced** (default) and tune based on observation:

**If memory feels empty or incomplete:**
- Increase `maxMemories` (3 → 5 → 10)
- Lower `minConfidence` (0.80 → 0.70 → 0.50)

**If memory feels noisy or off-topic:**
- Decrease `maxMemories` (10 → 5 → 3)
- Increase `minConfidence` (0.50 → 0.70 → 0.80)
- Disable `sync.onSessionStart` (inject on-demand only)

**If injection is slow or context balloons:**
- Lower `tokenBudget` (4000 → 2000 → 1000)
- Increase `minConfidence` (filter stricter)
- Disable `sync.onSessionStart`

After changing config:
```bash
# 1. Edit ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
# 2. Restart gateway
openclaw gateway restart
# 3. Test with a query in your project
```

## Deployment

### Single-Node (Current, Recommended)

All agents share `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/`. File-based, automatically synchronized. No coordination overhead needed.

**Covers 99% of real deployments.** One machine, many agents, shared memory.

### Multi-Node (Future)

Each Gateway would have isolated memory. If you scale to multiple Gateways, add a sync layer: shared filesystem, central DB, Git-based sync, or S3-compatible storage. This is not v1.4 scope.

---

## Tuning

ClawText works out of the box. If you want to tune:

### Hot Cache Admission

In `src/hot-cache.ts`:

```javascript
admissionConfidence: 0.60,  // Min confidence to enter cache (0.0–1.0)
admissionScore: 0.8,        // Min BM25 score to enter cache
maxItems: 300,              // Max items in cache
defaultTtlDays: 14,         // Days before memory expires
stickyTtlDays: 60,          // Days before high-confidence memory expires
```

**When to adjust:**
- Hit rate dropping → lower thresholds
- Cache filling with noise → raise thresholds

### Monitor

```bash
npm run health
# Reports: hit rate, cache size, staleness, review backlog, recommendations
```

Target hit rate: **>95%**

## What ClawText Is & Isn't

### ✅ ClawText IS

- A practical, file-based memory system for multi-agent coordination
- Fully auditable (no hidden databases)
- Operationally maintainable (YAML configs, explicit pipelines)
- Safe by default (token budgeting, confidence thresholds, hygiene patterns)
- Deployable without external dependencies (no vector DB required)

### ❌ ClawText IS NOT

- A hidden long-context dump
- A vector-database-first architecture
- A replacement for human review on risky changes
- A license to ingest arbitrary untrusted content without controls
- Self-improving code (v1 focuses on guidance capture, not auto-rewrite)
