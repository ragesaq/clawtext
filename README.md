## How Memory Works in Agent Systems

### The Problem

Every time an LLM processes a request, it builds a prompt from three layers:

1. **System instructions** — Core rules and identity (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md in OpenClaw)
2. **Context** — Background information to inform the response
3. **Current request** — What you're asking right now

Without persistent memory, the context layer is empty. Every session starts from zero:

```
Session 1:
[System] + [CONTEXT: EMPTY] + "Where was Caesar's greatest military victory?"
→ Response: "Battle of Alesia in 52 BC"

Session 2 (new conversation):
[System] + [CONTEXT: EMPTY] + "Who was that guy he defeated in that battle you told me about yesterday?"
→ Response: "What battle? I don't have any context from our previous conversation."

With a memory system:
[System] + [CONTEXT: Battle of Alesia, Caesar's military history] + "Who was that guy he defeated?"
→ Response: "Vercingetorix, the Gallic chieftain. That victory at Alesia was decisive because..."
```

Memory systems fill that context layer with information that persists across sessions. The agent remembers previous conversations, decisions, and can build on past work rather than relearning the same things.

### OpenClaw's Built-In Memory

OpenClaw agents already have basic memory through `MEMORY.md` — a static file for recording decisions and facts. It works for small projects. It doesn't scale. It requires manual maintenance and can't grow beyond a few hundred entries.

**ClawText doesn't replace `MEMORY.md`; it complements it.** MEMORY.md stays high-signal and hand-curated. ClawText handles the dynamic, scalable parts: conversational captures, bulk imports, tiered retrieval, automatic maintenance, and learned patterns from failures.

## What Is ClawText?

ClawText is a knowledge lifecycle system with three integrated lanes:

| Lane | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Working Memory** | Captures conversation context automatically. Tiered retrieval injects the right memories at prompt time. |
| **Knowledge Ingest** | Bulk-loads repos, docs, Discord forums/threads, exports, and other structured knowledge sources. Queryable on-demand. |
| **Operational Learning** | Captures tool failures and recurring errors. Reviews patterns with agents. Promotes stable lessons into durable guidance. |

## What's New in v1.4.0

### Automatic Memory Pipeline

ClawText now runs a three-stage pipeline automatically:

1. **Extraction (every 20 min)** — Messages captured to `memory/extract-buffer.jsonl`, then extracted facts/decisions/learnings written to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` using LLM
2. **Clustering (nightly)** — Daily 2am UTC cron rebuilds semantic clusters from daily memories, validates RAG quality, notifies if confidence < 70%
3. **Injection (every prompt)** — `before_prompt_build` hook injects top 5 relevant memories (by BM25 + semantic similarity) automatically — zero latency (~1ms), token-budgeted, confidence-filtered

**Result:** You get context-aware responses without manual memory searches. All memories are discoverable via `memory_search` as well.

### Bundled Ingest Engine

Knowledge ingest engine is now fully bundled into ClawText (previously separate `clawtext-ingest` package). Supports Discord, repos, docs, JSON, and more — all in one install.

### State Root Adoption

Runtime-generated state now lives under `~/.openclaw/workspace/state/clawtext/prod/`:
- Cluster indices
- Evaluation metrics
- Extraction checkpoints

This keeps the repo clean and separates sources (git-tracked) from runtime state (not git-tracked).

---

## What's New in v1.5.0

### Lightweight Relationship Tracking

v1.5 adds explicit, human-readable relationship tracking for grouping and cross-referencing related memories, patterns, and decisions.

**Why relationships matter:**
- **Grouped discovery** — "Show me all RGCS quaternion issues" returns a logical group, not scattered search results
- **Cross-project tracking** — Explicit links show how changes in one project affect others (e.g., RGCS VR tracking → Lumbot voice latency)
- **Decision trees** — Complex decisions can reference their dependencies and cascading impacts
- **Agent-maintainable** — Pure YAML, no database, human-readable

**Structure:** `memory/clusters/relationships.yaml` (optional, maintained by agents or humans)

```yaml
shortcuts:
  - name: "RGCS Quaternion Issues"
    connects:
      - "anti-pattern:quaternion-double-normalize"
      - "recovery-pattern:NaN-edge-case-fix"
      - "decision:RGCS-OneEuro-filter-params"

edges:
  - type: "causes"
    from: "anti-pattern:quaternion-double-normalize"
    to: "error-pattern:NaN-in-quaternion-math"
    confidence: 0.92
```

**Agent workflow:** Weekly relationship review (15 min) keeps relationships fresh, promotes new connections, archives dormant ones. See `HEARTBEAT.md` and `AGENT_CLAWTEXT_BEST_PRACTICES.md` for details.

**Best for:**
- Complex operational patterns
- Cross-project dependencies
- Decision rationale chains
- Known recurring issues that need quick grouping

Relationships are *optional* — the system works great without them. But they become valuable as your memory grows and you want explicit structure beyond semantic similarity.

## Three Lanes in Depth

### Lane 1: Working Memory

Captures from conversations and stores them in a tiered system. Memory doesn't just sit there — the system actively retrieves and injects the most relevant items at prompt time.

```
Conversation captures
       ↓
Conversational → Raw staging buffer (L4)
       ↓ review/promotion
Gets validated, ranked, deduped
       ↓
Full history searchable (L3)
       ↓ hot-admitted by relevance score
Curated, indexed memories (L2)
       ↓ selected, injected into prompt
Fast retrieval (~1ms) (L1)
```

**Key properties:**
- **BM25 scoring** — term frequency + confidence weighting + project-aware ranking
- **Semantic clustering** — memories grouped by topic, not just timestamp
- **Deduplication** — SHA1 hashing prevents re-storing duplicate knowledge
- **Token budgeting** — never exceeds your configured prompt context budget
- **Sticky retention** — high-value memories stay readily available longer

#### How Conversation Capture Works

ClawText automatically captures all conversation context (incoming and outgoing messages) without any action on your part.

**The pipeline (fully automatic):**

```
Every message event (in/out)
       ↓
[clawtext-extract hook] — appends to buffer (zero-LLM-cost)
       ↓ (asynchronous)
Memory/extract-buffer.jsonl (rolling 24h buffer)
       ↓ every 20 minutes
[Extraction cron] — LLM extracts facts, decisions, learnings
       ↓
Memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (YAML-formatted daily memories)
       ↓ triggered if 3+ extracted
[Cluster rebuild] — semantic grouping, dedup, indexing
       ↓
Hot cache + RAG injection
       ↓
Injected automatically into next prompt (~1ms latency)
```

**Key points:**
- **Hook runs on every message** — captures both you and the agent
- **Zero cost at capture time** — just appends JSON lines to a buffer file
- **Automatic extraction every 20 minutes** — background cron processes the buffer
- **Session flush on `/new`** — if you start a fresh conversation, the current buffer drains immediately so nothing is lost
- **Daily rebuild at 2am UTC** — full cluster rebuild + quality validation
- **Format stored** — JSONL in buffer, then YAML in daily memory files:

```yaml
# Example extracted memory
- id: mem_20260310_001
  timestamp: 2026-03-10T09:02:00Z
  type: decision
  topic: ClawText
  content: "Decided to bundle clawtext-ingest into main package for unified installation story"
  confidence: 0.95
  project: openclaw
```

**You don't need to do anything.** Conversation capture is always on. The system handles extraction, clustering, deduplication, and injection automatically.

---

### Lane 2: Knowledge Ingest

Bulk-loads external knowledge sources into a searchable base kept separate from working memory. Why separate? Injecting a 500KB codebase into every prompt wastes tokens and confuses the LLM. Knowledge repos live separately — your agent queries them on-demand when it needs specifics.

**Supported sources:**
- GitHub repos and local code directories
- Markdown/documentation folders
- Discord forums, channels, and threads (with full conversation hierarchy)
- JSON exports from any source
- Raw text and structured data

```bash
# Ingest a Discord forum
npm run ingest:discord -- --forum-id 123456789 --mode batch --verbose

# Ingest a folder of docs
clawtext-ingest ingest-files --input="docs/**/*.md" --project=myproject

# Ingest a full codebase
clawtext-ingest ingest-files --input="src/**/*.{ts,js}" --project=myapp

# Check knowledge repo freshness
npm run knowledge:status
# → 🟢 fresh (<30d) | 🟡 aging (30-90d) | 🔴 stale (>90d)
```

Knowledge repos are automatically tracked for staleness. The system alerts you (and agents) when imports need refreshing.

---

### Lane 3: Operational Learning

The system learns from its own operational history. When tools fail or commands error, the system captures it. If the same error recurs, it becomes a pattern. Agents review the pattern, decide if it's useful, and promote stable lessons into durable guidance.

**Lifecycle:**

```
Tool/command fails or hook fires
          ↓
    [Capture: raw]     ← automatic, no action needed
          ↓ recurs N times
    [Candidate]        ← pattern promoted when it repeats
          ↓ agent-led review
    [Reviewed]
      ↙         ↘
  reject       approve
    ↓              ↓
 Archived    Ready for promotion
                   ↓
    Agent proposes target + user confirms
                   ↓
           ┌──────────────────┐
           │ Durable Guidance │
           │ SOUL.md          │
           │ AGENTS.md        │
           │ TOOLS.md         │
           │ project docs     │
           └──────────────────┘
```

**What gets captured:**
- Tool failures (automatic via hooks)
- Command/script failures
- Repeated error patterns
- Successful recovery patterns
- Optimization discoveries

**Why this matters:**
Most memory systems optimize for prompt efficiency — faster retrieval, better token use, cleaner context injection. Operational learning goes further: it makes the *system itself* more reliable. Recurring failures become reviewed guidance. Agent and system both learn from the same operational history. Over time, the system gets more robust and self-healing.

---

## Safety and Quality Model

ClawText is designed to avoid the two biggest memory failures:

1. **Storing things that should never be stored**
2. **Retrieving things that should never be injected**

Current controls include:

- **Hygiene patterns** for secrets and credentials
- **Raw-log detection** to keep pasted logs/tool dumps out of clusters
- **Anti-pattern walls** to block false associations
- **Token budgeting** for prompt injection
- **Approval-gated promotion** for durable operational guidance
- **File-based auditability** instead of hidden database state

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) and [RISK.md](./RISK.md) for detailed threat models.

## Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/clawtext
```

That's it. OpenClaw handles dependency installation, registration, and plugin activation automatically.

### What `openclaw plugins install` Does

- ✅ Downloads ClawText from npm
- ✅ Extracts to `~/.openclaw/extensions/clawtext/`
- ✅ Runs `npm install --ignore-scripts`
- ✅ Registers in `plugins.installs` config
- ✅ Enables the plugin automatically

### Configuration

After installation, customize memory behavior in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. The defaults (5 memories, 0.70 confidence, 2000 tokens) work for most workflows:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "clawtext": {
        "enabled": true,
        "memorySearch": {
          "sync": { "onSessionStart": true },
          "maxMemories": 5,
          "minConfidence": 0.70
        },
        "clusters": {
          "rebuildInterval": "0 2 * * *",
          "validationThreshold": 0.70
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Tuning:** Need tighter token budget? Use `maxMemories: 3, minConfidence: 0.80` (conservative). Want maximum context? Use `maxMemories: 10, minConfidence: 0.50` (aggressive). See [AGENT_SETUP.md](./AGENT_SETUP.md) for full tuning guide.

Then restart:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
openclaw plugins list          # Should show: clawtext | enabled
openclaw gateway status        # Should show: running
```

### Updates

```bash
openclaw plugins update clawtext      # Single plugin
openclaw plugins update --all         # All plugins
```

### Migrating from Older Versions

See [AGENT_SETUP.md → Migration](./AGENT_SETUP.md#migration-path-from-git-clone-to-plugin-system) for agent-led or manual upgrade paths (preserves all memory).

### Development / Local Setup

For development or modification:

```bash
openclaw plugins install -l ./path/to/clawtext
```

Or clone and install manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ragesaq/clawtext.git
cd clawtext
npm install
npm run build
openclaw plugins install -l .
```

### Agent-Assisted Setup

If you prefer guided setup (configuration tuning, initial knowledge ingest, etc.), ask an agent:

```
Help me set up ClawText: install, configure memory search, 
run a health check, and ingest [my docs/Discord/repo].
```

Agents follow [AGENT_SETUP.md](./AGENT_SETUP.md) and handle everything end-to-end.

## Deployment

### Single-Node (Current, Recommended)

All agents share `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/`. File-based, automatically synchronized. No coordination overhead needed.

**Covers 99% of real deployments.** One machine, many agents, shared memory.

### Multi-Node (Future)

Each Gateway would have isolated memory. If you scale to multiple Gateways, add a sync layer: shared filesystem, central DB, Git-based sync, or S3-compatible storage. This is not v1.4 scope.

---

## Tuning

ClawText works out of the box. If you want to tune:

### Hot Cache Admission

In `src/hot-cache.ts`:

```javascript
admissionConfidence: 0.60,  // Min confidence to enter cache (0.0–1.0)
admissionScore: 0.8,        // Min BM25 score to enter cache
maxItems: 300,              // Max items in cache
defaultTtlDays: 14,         // Days before memory expires
stickyTtlDays: 60,          // Days before high-confidence memory expires
```

**When to adjust:**
- Hit rate dropping → lower thresholds
- Cache filling with noise → raise thresholds

### Monitor

```bash
npm run health
# Reports: hit rate, cache size, staleness, review backlog, recommendations
```

Target hit rate: **>95%**

## What ClawText Is & Isn't

### ✅ ClawText IS

- A practical, file-based memory system for multi-agent coordination
- Fully auditable (no hidden databases)
- Operationally maintainable (YAML configs, explicit pipelines)
- Safe by default (token budgeting, confidence thresholds, hygiene patterns)
- Deployable without external dependencies (no vector DB required)

### ❌ ClawText IS NOT

- A hidden long-context dump
- A vector-database-first architecture
- A replacement for human review on risky changes
- A license to ingest arbitrary untrusted content without controls
- Self-improving code (v1 focuses on guidance capture, not auto-rewrite)
