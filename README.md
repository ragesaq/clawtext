## What ClawText does

ClawText is a layered memory and continuity system for OpenClaw agents.

It captures what matters from active work, retrieves it automatically when relevant, and packages context so agents continue where they left off — across sessions, threads, and surfaces — without manual re-explanation.

## How LLM agents lose context

Every LLM conversation is assembled at runtime. The model doesn't "remember" anything — it sees only what's in the prompt at that moment:

| Prompt slot | Source | Persists across sessions? |
|---|---|---|
| **System prompt** | Agent config — identity, behavior, instructions | ✅ injected every session |
| **Conversation history** | Current session messages only | ❌ resets on every new session |
| **Prior context** | Past decisions, resolved problems, prior work | ❌ not populated by default |

That empty third slot is where agent continuity breaks. Two questions show exactly how this plays out:

| Question | What the LLM has | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| *"What was Caesar's greatest military victory?"* | Training data — general world knowledge | ✅ Answered correctly — no session context needed |
| *"What did we decide about the retry logic last week?"* | Nothing — prior session is gone | ❌ No answer — the decision existed only in that session |

The difference isn't intelligence. It's what's in that third slot. Filling it — automatically, reliably, without manual work — is the problem ClawText solves.

---

## How OpenClaw addresses context today

Those two questions are a useful lens for understanding what OpenClaw's context system already handles well, and where the gap is.

OpenClaw injects a structured set of guidance files into every session:

| File | What it contributes | Caesar question | Retry logic question |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SOUL.md` | Agent identity, voice, principles | ✅ Consistent, identity-aware answer | ✅ Same voice and reasoning style |
| `USER.md` | User preferences, working style, commitments | ✅ Tailored to the user's context | ✅ Knows how the user thinks about decisions |
| `AGENT.md` | Task focus, project-level instructions | ✅ Relevant if historical context is defined | ⚠️ Only if someone wrote the decision here |
| `MEMORY.md` | Hand-curated decisions, facts, patterns | ✅ If someone added Caesar context manually | ⚠️ Only if someone remembered to write it down |

OpenClaw's guidance files are powerful for identity and preferences — they're always current because they're always maintained. But the retry logic decision? It lives in the prior session. If nobody manually captured it into `MEMORY.md`, that session boundary erased it.

The system is only as strong as its last manual update.

---

## What ClawText adds

ClawText answers the retry logic question without `MEMORY.md` ever being touched. The decision was captured automatically when it was made, scored, indexed, and stored. At prompt time, ClawText queries across everything and injects the most relevant results.

| Prompt slot | OpenClaw default | With ClawText |
|---|---|---|
| **System prompt** | Guidance files (manual) | Same, plus auto-enriched operational guidance |
| **Conversation history** | Current session only | Current session only |
| **Prior context** | `MEMORY.md` if manually updated | ✅ Auto-retrieved from all prior sessions, ingested docs, and promoted patterns |

And it goes further. What happens when a session has been running for days and the thread is getting long? That working state — the live decisions, the active answers, the in-progress context — needs to move. ClawBridge packages the full working state and transfers it intact to a new thread, session, or surface. Not a summary. Not a copy of messages. The actual working context — knowledge, decisions, and answers as a unit — moves with the work.

| Question | OpenClaw default | With ClawText + ClawBridge |
|---|---|---|
| *"What was Caesar's greatest military victory?"* | ✅ Answered from training | ✅ Same — plus historically consistent with prior agent context |
| *"What did we decide about the retry logic last week?"* | ❌ Session boundary erased it | ✅ Auto-retrieved from prior session capture |
| *"We're starting a new thread — what did we establish?"* | ❌ Context lost at thread boundary | ✅ ClawBridge transferred the working state intact |

The `MEMORY.md` workflow still works. ClawText and ClawBridge build on top of it — without replacing it.

## Design philosophy

> Automatic where it makes sense. Agent-led with user review where it doesn't. CLI available throughout.

Every ClawText behavior falls into one of three operating modes. This isn't convention — it's the design contract that governs every feature decision:

| Behavior | Mode | What runs | What it means in practice |
|---|---|---|---|
| Session context capture | 🤖 **Automatic** | Extraction cron every 20 min | Every session generates memory without any action from you. Decisions, patterns, and resolved problems enter the pipeline immediately. |
| Semantic index rebuild | 🤖 **Automatic** | Nightly at 2am UTC | The full BM25 + semantic index rebuilds on a schedule. Retrieval quality improves as memory grows, without touching a config. |
| Prior context injection | 🤖 **Automatic** | Every prompt, token-budgeted | The most relevant prior context surfaces at prompt time. If you've done the work before, the agent knows. No commands, no prompting. |
| Failure + pattern capture | 🤖 **Automatic** | On every tool error | Tool failures, retries, and recovery paths are queued to the operational learning lane automatically. The system learns from mistakes without you logging them. |
| External source ingest | 👤 **Agent-led** | On demand via CLI | You or an agent decides what external sources to bring in — repos, docs, threads, URLs. The agent runs the ingest; the result enters the same retrieval pipeline as everything else. |
| Memory promotion | 👤 **Agent-led, you approve** | Review queue → approval | The agent identifies high-value candidates and proposes promotions. Nothing reaches permanent memory without your sign-off. The queue accumulates; you decide when to review. |
| `MEMORY.md` curation | 👤 **Agent-led, you approve** | Agent surfaces candidates | The agent proposes additions to `MEMORY.md` based on what it's seen. You approve. The curated fast-path stays curated, not bloated. |
| ClawBridge transfer | 👤 **Agent-led** | On demand via CLI | When work needs to move — new thread, new session, new agent — the agent runs ClawBridge to package and transfer the full working state. |
| Retrieval health | 🖥️ **CLI** | `npm run operational:retrieval:health` | Inspect pipeline status, index freshness, and retrieval quality at any time. |
| Operational queue | 🖥️ **CLI** | `openclaw run clawtext --operational` | Review, score, and act on the operational learning queue manually when needed. |
| Ingest control | 🖥️ **CLI** | `openclaw run clawtext --ingest` | Direct ingest of specific sources outside of agent-led flows. |

Nothing promotes to permanent memory without human approval. Everything is inspectable. This is non-negotiable.

## Architecture & Capabilities

ClawText is built on four lanes. Each owns a distinct part of the memory and continuity lifecycle — designed to be tuned, inspected, and operated independently.

### Lane 1 — Working Memory
**capture → extract → index → inject**

Every 20 minutes, the extraction cron pulls high-signal context from active sessions and stages it for indexing. Nightly, a full cluster rebuild reindexes everything using BM25 + semantic hybrid search. At every prompt build, the most relevant prior context is injected automatically — token-budgeted, no bloat.

Prior decisions, resolved problems, and earned patterns surface in new sessions without any manual work.

### Lane 2 — Ingest
**external sources → structured, searchable memory**

Repos, markdown docs, URLs, JSON exports, and Discord thread transcripts enter the same retrieval pipeline as session-captured memory. Ingested content is indexed alongside everything else — no separate lookup, no silos. Anything worth knowing becomes queryable.

### Lane 3 — Operational Learning
**failures and patterns → reusable organizational wisdom**

Tool failures, recovery workflows, and successful operational patterns are captured automatically on error. A review queue accumulates candidates with recurrence scoring — one-time failures don't surface, repeated patterns do. The agent proposes promotions; you approve; promoted patterns persist as permanent retrievable guidance for all future sessions.

Teams stop re-learning the same lessons.

### Lane 4 — ClawBridge
**active working context → structured transfer → destination surfaces**

When work needs to move — a thread grows too long, a session needs to continue somewhere else, a new agent takes over — ClawBridge packages the full working state and transfers it intact.

This isn't a summary or a copy of messages. A ClawBridge packet carries the knowledge, decisions, and answers from an active session as a cohesive unit. Three artifacts are generated: a short human-readable summary, a full context packet for the next agent, and a bootstrap doc telling the next session exactly where to start and what not to re-derive.

ClawText remembers durable knowledge. ClawBridge moves active context. Both are required for true continuity.

### Memory layers

| Layer | What it holds | Latency | Durability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 — Hot cache** | Recent high-confidence context, active project state | Instant | Rebuilt as needed |
| **L2 — Curated memory** | Promoted decisions, protocols, preferences, project summaries | Fast | Permanent |
| **L3 — Searchable archive** | Daily notes, ingested docs, full session history | Indexed | Permanent |
| **L4 — Intake / staging** | Raw captures, review queue, scoring candidates | — | Transient |

## Install

### Agent-assisted install

Paste this into your agent:

```
Install and configure the ClawText plugin for OpenClaw.
Run: openclaw plugins install @openclaw/clawtext
Then verify: openclaw plugins list, openclaw hooks list, openclaw cron list
Confirm the extraction cron and before_prompt_build hook are both active.
If anything is missing, fix it before reporting done.
```

### Manual install

```bash
# Install
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/clawtext

# Verify
openclaw plugins list
openclaw hooks list
openclaw cron list
```

Expected output:
- `@openclaw/clawtext` in plugins list
- `before_prompt_build` hook registered
- extraction cron active (every 20 minutes)
- cluster rebuild cron active (nightly 2am UTC)

ClawText activates automatically from first run. No additional configuration required to start capturing context.

## Tuning — automatic behaviors

These knobs govern the pipeline that runs without any intervention. Adjusting them changes how aggressively ClawText captures and promotes context.

| Knob | Default | Controls | Raise when | Lower when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `admissionConfidence` | `0.60` | Minimum confidence to admit a capture into L2 curated memory | L2 is noisy — low-quality captures are getting through | Good context is being dropped — relevant decisions aren't surfacing |
| `admissionScore` | `0.80` | Minimum score for L1 hot cache admission | Hot cache is bloated or retrieval feels slow | Prompt context feels thin — relevant recent work isn't appearing |
| Extraction cron interval | Every 20 min | How often session context is extracted and staged for indexing | Sessions are stable and low-volume | High-activity sessions where recent context needs to arrive faster |
| Cluster rebuild schedule | Nightly 2am UTC | How often the full BM25 + semantic index is rebuilt | Memory is stable — rebuilds feel unnecessary | Index feels stale; retrieval misses recent captures |

### Health check
```bash
npm run operational:retrieval:health    # pipeline status, index freshness, retrieval quality
```

---

## Tuning — agent-led and manual

These behaviors run on demand and involve judgment calls. The agent surfaces candidates and proposes actions; you make the call.

| Behavior | How to trigger | What to decide |
|---|---|---|
| **Operational learning review** | `openclaw run clawtext --operational` | Review queued candidates, approve or dismiss promotions |
| **Memory promotion** | Agent proposes during session | Approve or reject — nothing enters permanent memory without your sign-off |
| **`MEMORY.md` curation** | Agent surfaces additions | Approve new entries — keeps the curated fast-path signal-dense, not bloated |
| **Ingest** | `openclaw run clawtext --ingest` | Direct what external sources to bring in — repos, docs, threads, URLs |
| **ClawBridge transfer** | Agent-led or CLI | Decide when work needs to move and where it should land |

### Operational learning threshold

The operational learning lane promotes based on **recurrence**. A pattern that appears once stays in the queue. Patterns that repeat accumulate score. Only consistent, recurring patterns cross the promotion threshold — one-off noise never reaches permanent memory.

### Queue status
```bash
openclaw run clawtext --operational:status    # review queue summary, recurrence counts
```
